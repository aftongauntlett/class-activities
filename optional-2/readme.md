Quick exercise:
Create an HTML with 4 buttons on the page. Write ONE event listener to handle any of the button clicks (hint: create a parent element).
When a button is clicked, the web page should read: "You just chose: " + whatever the button name is.
Optional: Put another button somewhere else on the page, and the other 4 buttons won't respond unless this button has been clicked first. (Like a "Start Exercise" kind of thing.)
Bonus: style one of the buttons with a different color. When THAT button is clicked, the text readout should match the color. (Hint: use attributes as a way of handling this.)
